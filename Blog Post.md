# Cannabis and the Economy
## How could the UK economy benefit from the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use?

The illegal cannabis trade in the UK is estimated to be worth approximately £2.6 billion annually (Whiterow, 2024).  How could the United Kingdom reap the benefits that numerous countries across the world have seen since legalising recreational cannabis usage?

Recreational cannabis can be defined as the use of cannabis for enjoyment as opposed to for the health benefits (Robinson, 2022). The cannabis used for recreational use is often no different to the medicinal cannabis that is not only legalised by the UK, which is ‘the world’s biggest producer and exporter of legal cannabis for medical and scientific purposes'(Buchanan et al., 2023). So how come with most recreational cannabis users falling into the category of self-medication, can the law prevent an individual from gaining access even as doctors continue prescribing it’s use?

## Exploration 

Legalising recreational cannabis means removing legislations that currently prohibit the use, sale or production of cannabis. Through doing this cannabis will become a regulated, legal goods similar to alcohol or tobacco. By allowing cannabis onto the open market, the opportunity to boost the GDP of the UK is one not to miss. The alcohol and tobacco industries combined brought in £22.4 billion in tax revenue in the financial year 2022/23 with a market value of  £68.2 billion. Assuming the tax rate for recreational cannabis is charged at a similar level at an estimated tax rate of  30% the United Kingdom could generate £780 Million in tax annually from taxes based on the current market value. So what does the data suggest?

We can see that compared to the recreational cannabis markets in a number of countries where recreational cannabis use is legal that the United Kingdom is second only to that of Canada.  The wealth of untapped potential that can be unlocked through the legalisation and regulation of the recreational cannabis industry, is evidently clear. So why is the UK closing itself off to what can only be described as a lucrative new market?

As we see above the recreational cannabis market in the United Kingdom is valued higher than all bar that of Canada. Thus, we can look to see how Canada has benefited since it legalised recreational and medicinal cannabis back in 2018. Cannabis sales totalled $11 billion of which over two thirds were recreational sales.  It is estimated that between 2018-2021 there was a $43.5 billion boost to the Canadian GDP that could be directly attributed to legalisation. Of this boost to the economy, a whopping $25.2 billion has come from labour income and the 151,000 jobs that have been sustained through the industry (Diamandiev et al., 2021).

On top of this GDP boost, the Canadian government has seen tax revenues boosted by $15.1 billion, with only $1 billion being directly from sales (Diamandiev et al., 2021). This shows that the direct taxation of cannabis is only the tip of the iceberg when looking at the potential tax that can be generated, with 94% of the tax raised being from other sources. So what could this mean for the UK?

We can see the United Kingdom has the highest spend on cannabis per user, 68% higher than that of Canada which has benefited so highly, so how could the UK replicate this Canadian success story for itself.

|*Annual Cannabis Spend Per Person*|


Following legalisation, the UK could see a number of scenarios happen, I have decided to investigate a variety of scenarios some of which I kept the spend per user the same and increased the prevalence and some where the prevalence increased but saw a decrease in the annual spend per user.  In the table, we can see that total market value could exceed £3.5 billion regardless of the potential scenarios. As the cannabis market value increases, there is also a necessity for increasing the production capability. This in turn requires more capital expenditure as the cannabis industry will need to build infrastructure to allow for cannabis production to effectively meet the necessary levels.

| Scenario                                                        | Market Value     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Scenario 1: Prevalence Increases In line with Canada at +5% per person      | 4.43 Billion GBP |
| Scenario 2: Prevalence doubles after legalisation               | 5.20 Billion GBP |
| Scenario 3: Prevalence Increases in Line with Canada, -10% annual spend per person| 3.99 Billion GBP |
| Scenario 4: Prevalence doubles, -10% annual spend per person| 4.68 Billion GBP |
| Scenario 5: Prevalence Increases in Line with Canada, -20% annual spend per person| 3.54 Billion GBP |
| Scenario 6: Prevalence doubles, -20% annual spend per person                      | 4.16 Billion GBP |

Furthermore, when looking at the estimated taxation level for cannabis mentioned previously, and incorporating the information that direct sales represented only 6% of the total increase in tax benefits for the Canadian government; we can try to make further estimates as to the total taxation profits. As mentioned previously, should the UK tax recreational cannabis at a 30% rate similar to the aggregate rate for alcohol and tobacco. The potential annual tax benefits have the potential to exceed a total value of  around $20 billion annually. So again for a country where funding for the NHS fails to grow at the historical rate creating a £5.4 billion windfall, why not find every opportunity to fight against cuts to the things that make the UK the country it is.

|*Projected Tax After Legalisation*|


The benefits from legalisation aren’t purely economical, as of February 2020 there was 853 prisoners with a cannabis related offence (Ministry of Justice, 2020). With every prisoner costing the United Kingdom £48,409 annually in the financial year 2020-21 (Ministry of Justice, 2023), legalisation could not only save the UK over £41 million in costs incurred by the prison service, but also provide a range of viable careers in a legal sector that currently leaves people indebted and locked into ‘employment’ of often violent criminal gangs. Individuals currently involved in the cultivation of illegal cannabis within the UK would no longer be marginalised members of society but potentially influential market leaders with a practical knowledge in an industry that will initially be lacking. Criminal gangs will not only see a potential exodus of individuals involved but also see a potentially crippling disruption to economic activities that currently sustain and allow for the continued survival of these gangs.

## Popular Culture 
What could we learn about cannabis production from popular culture shows such as ‘The Gentleman’ by Guy Ritchie? The main premise of this show can be used to examine how criminal gangs have existing networks across the country, and how could legalisation utilise these networks. Whist the network in The Gentleman utilises the landed gentry it is no stretch of the imagination that currently within the UK criminal gangs already have a comprehensive network for the production and distribution of cannabis nationwide. So again, in the interest of the wider population, why not give these criminal gangs the opportunity to go legitimate and utilise their networks to help the roll out of a new industry. 

## Drawbacks of Legalisation
However, the recreational cannabis industry is no silver bullet as it brings with it a wide range of problems. One of the most obvious drawbacks is whilst there is a need for new infrastructure to cope with demand is clear there is also a raft of problems that arise. The development of land is not the only issue with infrastructure used for cannabis cultivation. Indoor facilities require huge amounts of electricity in order to run the systems, such as lighting, essential for the growth and drying. All of these processes produce vast quantities of greenhouse gases with each kilogram of dried cannabis in Canada producing up to ‘5,184 kg in average life cycle CO2 emissions’(Diamandiev et al., 2021). Beyond the environmental issues associated with cannabis production, post legalisation there will be a time period where cannabis production can’t cope with the demand. This could lead to illegal operations to continue in order to fulfil the demand, which in turn can cause further environmental issues as well as creating a risk to public safety as criminal gangs fill the void and with this comes violent crimes as such organisations seek to protect their interests in any way necessary.  

## Conclusion 
There is undeniably an enormous number of benefits that the legalisation of recreational cannabis will allow for beyond just the ability to add billions to the GDP of the United Kingdom and raising millions in taxation. This boost to the economy, is further backed up by the other benefits including a lower stress on the already overcrowded prison services as well as the potential to disrupt criminal activities. However, in a country that prides itself on pushing down its emissions from greenhouse gases, is the environmental impact too much to justify the economic benefits as the need to offset carbon dioxide produced could cost unnecessary millions. Regardless of all things the decision remains at the hands of the parliaments, and as we all know, their decision is final.
